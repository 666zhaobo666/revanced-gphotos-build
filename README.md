# ReVanced GPhotos: Unlimited Storage on Google Photos

ReVanced GPhotos unlocks **unlimited original quality photo and video storage** by spoofing your device as a **Google Pixel XL**, allowing non-Pixel and **non rooted devices** to enjoy the same benefits. 

## Installation
1. Download and log in to [GmsCore](https://github.com/ReVanced/GmsCore/releases/latest).
2. Install the latest version of [ReVanced GPhotos](https://github.com/Unofficial-Life/revanced-gphotos-build/releases/latest).
3. Open ReVanced GPhotos and allow it to process your media (this may take time depending on your library).

**Note**: You will need to manually select your account each time you open the app, but it will continue to work in the background after the initial login.

## Benefits
- **Unlimited Storage**: Backup photos and videos without worrying about Google 15gb limit.
- **Original Quality**: Keep your media uncompressed and at full quality.

## Disclaimer
This patch modifies Google Photos, which may violate Googleâ€™s terms of service. Use at your own risk.
