ReVanced GPhotos unlocks **unlimited original quality photo and video storage** by spoofing your device as a **Google Pixel XL**, allowing non-Pixel and **non rooted devices** to enjoy the same benefits.

3. Open ReVanced GPhotos and allow it to process your media (this may take time depending on your library).

**Note**: You will need to manually select your account each time you open the app, but it will continue to work in the background after the initial login.

## Benefits
- **Unlimited Storage**: Backup photos and videos without worrying about Google Drive limits.
- **Original Quality**: Keep your media uncompressed and at full quality.
